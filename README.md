> [!NOTE]
> It is important to note that we still found a difference of a few seconds between the RTC times.  
> It is recommended to check and calibrate the time before starting the test.


## Steps for use:
1. Make sure the memory card is inserted into the machine, else it won't do anything.
2. Connect power supply (battery, solar panel, power bank or a bunch potato)
3. Check if the error light is on
4. The system will start recording data automatically.

## Making your own:
1. Gether each part
2. Make the pcb
3. Combine every parts
4. Upload firmware
5. Insert MicroSD card
6. Connect power supply
7. There is no step 7
8. Profit :-)
